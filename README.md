There were two parts to this assignment. Both tasks were written from what we learned in class. ChatGPT was used for debugging. The first task was writing phyton code to ‘Extract’ and ‘Transform’ files. Visual Studio was used as the tool to write the code. The second part of the assignment, ‘Load’, was done using PostreSQL as the application.  An Enterprise Relationship Diagram was needed. This was developed using the below website:

Once the ERD is constructed the application allows one to export to the appropriate SQL application. This is how the tables were created in PostgreSQL. Once the table structure was defined in the PostreSQL database, the tool allows files to be imported for adding data to the tables.

The files are in the Resources folder, the ERD and SQL code are also provided.
